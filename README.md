**Your slightly chaotic but surprisingly capable TUI (Text User Interface) notes and task manager, guided by the ever-forgetful Manager-chan!**

Welcome to the official repository for Manager-chan Notes! She tries her *absolute best* to keep track of your notes, tasks, and ideas directly in your terminal. She offers features found in powerful note-taking apps, but with a unique twist: she's prone to forgetting things over time and occasionally misspelling words. Don't worry, it's (mostly) configurable!

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Full TUI Interface:** Clean, keyboard-driven terminal UI powered by `prompt_toolkit`.
*   **Rich Note Formatting:** Write notes using **Markdown**! Rendered beautifully in the details pane with `rich`.
*   **Comprehensive Metadata:** Organize notes with:
    *   ‚úÖ Status (Todo, In Progress, Done, Archived)
    *   ‚ùó Priority (A, B, C)
    *   üè∑Ô∏è Tags (Multiple, comma-separated)
    *   üìÖ Due Dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
    *   üïí Creation & Modification Timestamps
*   **Powerful Management:**
    *   üîÑ **Sorting:** Sort by priority, due date, status, creation/modification time, or text.
    *   üîé **Filtering:** Filter by status, priority, tag, or archived status.
    *   üìù **Search:** Quickly search through note titles and content.
*   **Manager-chan Persona:** Cute ASCII art and contextual status messages provide personality (can be disabled).
*   **Configurable Forgetfulness:** Manager-chan might "forget" older items based on configurable probability and time windows.
*   **Configurable Misspelling:** She might also occasionally misspell words during display (can be configured to save permanently, default is display-only).
*   **Settings Panel:** Tweak forgetfulness, misspelling, and other options via an in-app settings panel (`Ctrl+S`).
*   **Persistence:** Notes and settings are saved locally in JSON files (`manager_chan_notes.json`, `manager_chan_settings.json`) in the current directory.

## ü§î The Forgetful Mechanic (It's a Feature!)

Manager-chan's defining characteristic is her unreliable memory. This isn't just a bug, it's a core (and configurable) part of the experience:

1.  **Timed Forgetting:** Notes don't vanish immediately. Forgetting only *starts* after a configurable delay (default: 7 days).
2.  **Probability Window:** The *chance* of an item being forgotten increases gradually over a configurable time window following the initial delay (default: 14 days).
3.  **Configurable:** You can adjust the delay, the window, the base probability, or disable forgetting entirely via the Settings Panel (`Ctrl+S`).
4.  **`--dont-forget` Flag:** Use this command-line argument for sessions where you absolutely cannot risk losing information.
5.  **Misspelling:** A separate, configurable chance for Manager-chan to make minor typos when displaying text. By default, these are *not* saved permanently, but this can be changed in settings. Much useful for memory management.

This mechanic adds a unique, slightly unpredictable element. Can you get things done before Manager-chan forgets them?

## üöÄ Installation

You need Python 3.7 or later and `pip`.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DevlopRishi/manager-chan.git
    cd manager-chan
    ```
2.  **Install the package using pip:**
    This command builds the package and installs it, along with its dependencies (`prompt_toolkit`, `rich`), and makes the `manager-chan` command available.
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
    *Alternatively, for development, you can install in editable mode:*
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## üíª Usage

Once installed, run the application from anywhere in your terminal using the command:

```bash
manager-chan
```

To run without any forgetfulness or misspelling for the current session:

```bash
manager-chan --dont-forget
```

Your notes (`manager_chan_notes.json`) and settings (`manager_chan_settings.json`) will be saved in the directory where you run the command.
